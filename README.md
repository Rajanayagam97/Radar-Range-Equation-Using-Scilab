# Radar-Range-Equation-Using-Scilab
## Evaluation of Radar Range Using Scilab

## Aim
To calculate the maximum range of a radar system using the Radar Range Equation and verify the results through Scilab programming.

## Theory 
The Radar Range Equation is a key relationship used in radar system design to determine the maximum distance (range) at which a radar can detect a target.It is given by:

## Procedure
1. Refer to the Algorithm and write the Scilab code for the experiment

2. Open Scilab on your system.
   
3. Create a New Editor File: Go to File → New → Script.
   
4. Type Your Code in the editor window.

5. Save the File with a suitable name (e.g., radar_range.sce).

6. Execute the Code: Press F5 or click Execute → File with echo.

7. If Any Errors Occur: Review and correct the code. Save and run it again until it executes successfully.
