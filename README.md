## Evaluation of Radar Range Using Scilab

## Aim
To calculate the maximum range of a radar system using the Radar Range Equation and verify the results through Scilab programming.

## Theory 
The Radar Range Equation is a key relationship used in radar system design to determine the maximum distance (range) at which a radar can detect a target.It is given by:
